    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Adobo is a popular Filipino dish and cooking process that involves
      marinating and simmering meat, usually pork or chicken, in a mixture of
      vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, and various spices. The dish is
      known for its savory, slightly tangy, and often slightly sweet flavor
      profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cooking process typically involves marinating the meat in the adobo
      sauce for a period of time to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.
      After marinating, the meat is then simmered in the same sauce until it is
      tender. Adobo can be served with rice and is a staple in Filipino cuisine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's worth noting that adobo can vary in terms of ingredients and
      preparation methods, as different regions and families may have their own
      variations of the dish. Additionally, adobo is not unique to the
      Philippines; variations of adobo are found in other cuisines, including
      those in Latin America and Spain, each with its own distinct flavors and
      ingredients.
