        <strong>Boil the Meat:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a large pot, boil the oxtail and/or tripes until tender. Skim off
            any impurities that rise to the surface. Reserve the broth.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare Vegetables:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            While the meat is boiling, prepare the vegetables. Slice the banana
            hearts, string beans, and eggplant into bite-sized pieces.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the Peanut Sauce:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a separate pan, sauté finely chopped onions and garlic in oil
            until fragrant. Add peanut butter, ground toasted rice, and crushed
            peanuts. Stir well.

        <strong>Add Annatto Seeds (Optional):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If desired, add annatto seeds soaked in water to the mixture to
            achieve a reddish color. Discard the seeds after extracting the
            color.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>

          <li>
            Gradually add the broth from the boiled meat to the peanut mixture,
            stirring continuously to create a smooth sauce. Adjust the thickness
            according to preference.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook Vegetables:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add the sliced vegetables to the pot with the boiling meat. Cook
            until the vegetables are tender.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combine Sauce and Meat/Vegetables:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Once the meat and vegetables are cooked, combine them with the
            peanut sauce. Simmer until the flavors meld together.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
